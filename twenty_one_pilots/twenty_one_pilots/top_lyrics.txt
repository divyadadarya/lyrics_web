All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're loving on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're loving on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're loving on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
(It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away
(Away)
And now they're outside ready to bust
(To bust)
It looks like you might be one of us

I know you're not a liar
And I know you could set fire
This day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down
I am calling your lightning
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me
Your face

Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down

I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Why wouldn't you let us use your name?

Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me
Reign down
And destroy me

Reign

Down

Reign

Down

Down
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't, I don't wanna fall, fall away
I will keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away

I disguise
And I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away
As I stand in line
And I die as I wait as I wait on my crime
And I'll try to delay what you make of my life
But I don't want your way,
I want mine
I'm dying and I'm trying
But believe me I'm fine
But I'm lying,
I'm so very far from fine

And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I will keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away

Every time I feel selfish ambition
Is taking my vision
My crime is my sentence
Repentance is taking commission
It's taking a toll
On my soul
I'm screaming submission and,
I don't know if I am dying or living
'Cause I will save face
For name's sake
Abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name
And a newer place
But my name is lame
I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became
New destiny to the grave

And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin,
It will start to break up and fall apart

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I will keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
Three, four

Your grandpa died
When you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon

Now it's your turn
To be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now the Pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favourite shirt
And all your friends
Fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now,
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favourite shirt
And all your friends
Fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
'Cause your skin is so used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favourite shirt
And all your friends
They fertilise 
The ground you walk
So lose your mind

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favourite shirt
And all your friends
They fertilise
The ground you walk
Lose your mind
Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best
Of sons
Hello
I've been traveling in
The deserts of my mind
And I
Haven't found a drop
Of life
I haven't found a drop
Of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop
Of water

Water

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have
And it's all that I need and
The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
In all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
What's left in my hand
But no matter how
How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic
In fact,
I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow
But it's the end of today
End of my ways
As a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case
But you specialise in dying
You hear me screaming, "Father"
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water

Water

Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best
Of sons
Hello
I've been traveling in
The deserts of my mind
And I
I haven't found a drop
Of life
I haven't found a drop
Of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop
Of water
I feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was

Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone, denying you need someone
To exterminate your bones

Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me

Living like a ghost you walk by everyone you know
You say that you're fine but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know

Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me

Would you let me know your plans tonight?
'Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else left to say
But I will listen to you all day, yes I will

Friend, please remove your hands from
Over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but
Friend, please don't take your life away from me
There's miles of land in front of us
And we're dying with every step we take
We're dying with every breath we make
And I'll fall in line

A stranger's back is all I see
He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line

No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line

And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep

And as we're near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line

Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head:
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:
This line's the only way

And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
Follow me instead

Follow me instead
Follow me
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead

Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realise that this line is dead
So I'll follow You instead

So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea
He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie
But this time he decides that it's alright
It's alright

No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize
Before
He goes to lock the door

He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns

Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy
Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
You're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now

We all need you now

Someone said, "Away you go"
And someone said to you, "Goodbye"
They deflect
The disrespect
When they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time

We all know you're qualified
To fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified
But they lie when they blame it on the times
Oh, we blame it on the times

He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns

Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy
Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
You're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now

We all need you now

I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame

Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy
Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
You're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now

Get up, Johnny boy, get up, Johnny boy
Get up 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
You're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny boy, because we all need you now
Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty sleeper
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
Inside your head than the winter of dead

I will tell you I love you
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
To travel through snow
Together we go
Together we go

We get colder
As we grow older
We will walk
So much slower

Oh, Ms. Believer, my pretty weeper
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
Please, take my hand, we're in foreign land
As we travel through snow
Together we go
Together we go

We get colder
As we grow older
We will walk
So much slower
I don't fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound

My parachutes will guide me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed

I was doing fine on my own
And there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher
And I don't know if I want it back

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

'Cause I'm not sure
I want to give you
Tools that can destroy
My heart

And I just don't say
What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart
He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave

He pretends that he's OK
But you should see
Him in bed late at night
He's petrified

Take me out and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favour and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

He pretends he's OK
But you should see
Him in bed late at night
He's petrified

Take me out and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favour and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

Take me out and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favour and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

'Cause nobody knows he's alive
The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart

For me to drive away with
I began to understand
Why God died

The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night


And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw Him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way

I began to understand
Why God died

The air begins to feel a little thin
As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw
It held your heart

For me to walk away with
I began to understand
Why God died
I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way you're by my side until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid. We're going home"

I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal writing piece of song will help me carry on
But this you heard

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way you're by my side until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid. We're going home"

(Okay) So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab, had it cleared out back and two men started to unpack

Driving once again
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
"I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day"

Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for

Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, "Am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead?"
And then one turned around to say
"We're driving toward the morning, son
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone"

And I said, "Don't be afraid"
And I said, "Don't be afraid"
Open the slits in your face and start your day
You don't have much time to make your slits look just right

I'm in your mind
I'm singing
I'm in your mind
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da

Look in the mirror and ask your soul if you're alright
Put on the glitter that your soul hides behind

You're in my mind
I'm singing
You're in my mind
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da

Know you were made holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

Ah

And in your mind
You're singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da
Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing

All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now

If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart and the light will set us free

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I...

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I...

How frustrating and so degrading
His time, we're wasting
As time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
And he is waiting, oh, so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
Yeah, please don't think about why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking

Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine
(I promise you)

Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great,
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown,
Today, day, I want to go away, way,
'Cause things are too fast now,
I want to be in Slowtown.

I put my socks on my feet,
Just so that my soul won't fall through my toes,
And I walk through my door,
Just so I don't fall through the floor.

I remember when my brother and other kids from neighbouring houses,
Would get together, I'd ride my bike and my brother would ride his,
Put cards in our spokes and make our engine sound like traffic,
When using Pokémon cards, please do not use the holographics,

So bold and fearless in the risks we take,
Laugh in the face of gravity as its laws we'd break,
On trampolines so high, we reach for the sky, but I,
Do not look up anymore and I don't know why.

I put my socks on my feet,
Just so that my soul won't fall through my toes,
And I walk through my door,
Just so I don't fall through the floor.

We're going too fast, fast, save us.
We're going too fast, fast, save us.
We're going too fast, fast, save us now.

I walk through my door,
Just so I don't fall through the floor.

Hey, hey, wouldn't it be great, great,
If we could just lay down and wake up in Slowtown,
Just singing.
I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard
I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name, your name?

I scream, you scream, we all scream
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of something better.

Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up onto the page
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?

I scream, you scream, we all scream
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of something better.

Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Quickly moving towards the storm
Moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that?
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?

This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me. I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned.

Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote.

Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire

Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids,
Culture forbids,
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is,
Fall off the grid.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.
The eyes to sing along, long, long.

We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great,
I know some people who know people who are flying straight,
But I'll kindly enter into rooms of depression,
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again.

We live for the night's decor,
It reveals what we dream of.

I know there's someone at the door,
They called for help, of this I'm sure,
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes,
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along.

This room is far too dark for us to stay around,
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down.

I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go,
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
The eyes to sing along, long, long.

Make them stop 
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me, OK friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something then, it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you, and neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy
Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behaviour but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Oh oh oh oh oh
You will never know what's behind my skull
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what's under my hair
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what's under my skin
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

You will never know what is in my veins
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

And you will never know what I'm thinking of
So won't you say good night, so I can say goodbye

And you will never understand what I believe
So won't you say goodnight, so I can say goodbye

Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

Won't you go to someone else's dreams?
Won't you go to someone else's head?
Haven't you taken enough from me?
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?

I start to part
Two halves of my heart
In the dark and I
Don't know
Where I should go
And the tears
And the fears
Begin to multiply

Taking time in a simple place
In my bed
Where my head
Rests on a pillowcase
And it's said
That a war's led
But I forget
That I let another day go by

I wanna be afraid but it seems
That these days I'm caught under water
And I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder,
I'm calling my father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?

Empty sky, no way, that's me
'Cause one half of my heart is free
Empty sky, no way, that's me,
'Cause the other half of my heart's asleep
You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out, out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're gonna do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you.


Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

Your redemption won't grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me

I'm coming clean
God, hit me straight on. 


Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

You say things with your mouth,
Cobwebs and flies come out.
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily, I can read your mind


Don't be gone


You say things with your mouth,
Cobwebs and flies come out.
Ruby, I hope I see you, I've waited all this week
For you to walk my way, your soul will capture me
Your mama painted your room, "A shade of pink," she said
But with your great arrival that shade has turned to red.

Ruby, take my hand, please lead me to the Promised Land
Tell me where am I from? Your eyes say, "Shada de da dum."
Ruby, you're royalty in your home land, they all call you "Queen"
Tell me, where are you from? Your eyes say, "Shada de da dum."


You're an angel fallen down. Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky. How high? How high?

You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased
You hold the key.

You're an angel fallen down. Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky. How high? How high? How high?


Tell our dad I'm sorry.


You're an angel


Tell our dad I'm sorry.


You're an angel

Where'd you go, huh?
They all think I know you
It's so hard to motivate
Me to devote a
Single inch of me to
Something I can't see I
Don't mean to pry but why
Would you even make the eyes?
I don't believe my ears
And I'm scared of my own head
I will deny you for years
And I'll make you raise me from the dead
And if I said that I would live for you
For nothing in return
Well, I'm sorry Mr. Gullible
But lying's all I've learned

So be concerned
So be concerned
No music
And I could talk about anything
Whether or not it's worthwhile
It's based on who's listening
Most of us listen
If it's something we can relate to
All of us relate
If it's something we've just been through
Take it for granted
Trust is damaged and now we panic
Living empty-handed
Living lives like we can't manage, I can't feel you
But still know where home is feeling like Jonah did
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded

So be concerned
So be concerned
You should

OK
Alright

I am disappearing
Inside my bird's eye theories
I try to say goodbye, defy, and deny
What it is I'm fearing
Clearly I am dying, dearly I am writing
Merely testifying
That a test to fly requires I pass the test with colours flying
I don't believe you most of the time
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine
You are the pearl, I am the swine
So break my life and take this rhyme
I'm so sorry but I do believe
That all my bridges I have burned
And I've earned a policy of no return

So be concerned
So be concerned
So be concerned
So be concerned
I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works,
Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words,
I take my face off at the door 'cause I don't know who they will take me for,
I wonder if I tell them what I did last night,
Whether or not I got caught, they just might,
Wage war on you, therefore it's true,
That I shot my general on my side of enemy lines.


I'm the son of all I've done,
I'm the son of all I've done,
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.

I'm not trying to be lying to you,
But it takes a clever guy to do what I do,
It takes some chivalry and well placed energy,
To subliminally get yourself inside you,
Introspection is the name of this session,
Spread this infection, reflect it on the next one,
The next one, the next one, and when we're done,
We'll all have made something new under the sun,
I'm not done, I'm not done yet, no,
Kick me off the stage and take my microphone,
Then you'll walk up to me and when you get close,
I'll look you in the face and say, "Where's your home?
Where are you going and why are you here?"
Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?
Want to know what I believe? It's right here,
Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear, clear, clear


I'm the son of all I've done,
I'm the son of all I've done,
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.


I will tell you what I can,
But your mind will take a stand,
I sing of a greater love,
Let me know when you've had enough.
I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy,
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling,
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding,
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,
Why it's got to be like this. Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.

I'll stay awake,
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling,
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out,
I swear I heard demons yelling,
Those crazy words they were spelling,
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.

But I'll tell them,
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant.
Please tell them you have no plans for me.
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell them.

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate,
The start of a day when we put on our face,
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,
Desperately yelling there's something we need,
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times,
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime,
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards,
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.

I'll stay awake,
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling,
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out,
I swear I heard demons yelling,
Those crazy words they were spelling,
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.

But I'll tell them,
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant,
Please tell them, you have no plans for me,
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell them, you have no plans for me,
I will set my soul on fire,
What have I become?
I'll tell them,
I'll tell them,
I'll tell them,
I'll tell them,

Please tell them, you have no plans for me,
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'm sorry.
I'm taking over my body,
Back in control, no more shotty,
I bet a lot of me was lost,
Ts uncrossed and Is undotted,
I fought it a lot
And it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,
Not anymore, flesh out the door,
Swat,

I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,
And the story unfolds,
You should take my life,
You should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you 

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment,
Before you know it, time is slowing
And it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life,
It probably happens at night,
Right?

Fight it,
Take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree. Tell it, "You belong to me.
This ain't a noose, this is a leash.
And I have news for you: you must obey me."

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

Entertain my faith. 


Lean with it, rock with it,
When we gonna stop with it,
Lyrics that mean nothing,
We were gifted with thought,
Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat,
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts,
It's our hearts that make the beat.

And I'll be holding on to you. 
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I-I-I I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday
'Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenceless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block
My writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I'll get some sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult to be, stop feasting lumber-down trees
Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And now it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora's Box's contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked
This is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know we've made it this far, kid

We've made it this far
We've made it this f...
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you queen of everything you see,
I'll put you on the map,
I'll cure you of disease.

Let's say we up and left this town,
And turned our future upside down.
We'll make pretend that you and me,
Lived ever after happily.

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you queen of everything you see,
I'll put you on the map,
I'll cure you of disease.

Ohhhh...
And since we know that dreams are dead,
And life turns plans up on their head,
I will plan to be a bum,
So I just might become someone.

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you queen of everything you see,
I'll put you on the map,
I'll cure you of disease.
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my,
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

(Oooh) 

(Oooh)
And now I just sit in silence 
And now I just sit

And now I just sit in silence 
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence
Night falls with gravity,
The earth turns from sanity,
Taking my only friend I know,
He leaves a lot, his name is "Hope".

I'm never what I like,
I'm double-sided, and I just can't hide,
I kind of like it when I make you cry,
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.

The horrors of the night melt away,
Under the warm glow of survival of the day,
Then we move on,
My shadow grows taller, along with my fears,
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near.

When the sun is climbing window sills,
And the silver lining rides the hills,
I will be saved for one whole day,
Until the sun makes the hills its grave.

I'm never what I like,
I'm double-sided, and I just can't hide,
I kind of like it when I make you cry,
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.

I'm never what I like,
I'm double-sided, and I just can't hide,
I kind of like it when I make you cry,
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside my mind.

I'm semi-automatic, my prayer's schizophrenic,
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on.
I'm semi-automatic, my prayer's schizophrenic,
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on.
I'm semi-automatic, my prayer's schizophrenic,
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on.
I'm semi-automatic, my prayer's schizophrenic,
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on.

By the time the night wears off,
The dust is down and shadows burn,
I will rise and stand my ground,
Waiting for the night's return.

I'm never what I like,
I'm double-sided, and I just can't hide,
I kind of like it when I make you cry,
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside.

I'm never what I like,
I'm double-sided, and I just can't hide,
I kind of like it when I make you cry,
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up inside my mind.
I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it,
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Don't know why I think I could lie
'Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah, there's a screen on my chest


I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive
That's a train. Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane
My flow's not great, OK, I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.


I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh...


We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh.
We're broken people, oh.
Yeah


We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh.
We're broken people, oh.


I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
I can't take them on my own, my own
Pa, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

I am up against the wall, the wall
Pa, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder in one-way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Tonight I'll need you to stay! 
I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give you space to speak my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times
I have committed
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing

What kids are doing
They're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free

Am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away
There's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's OK

(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll break you down)

(I'll fake you out)
And I'll fall (I'll fake you out)
And I'll break
And I'll fake (all all I wanna)
All I wanna

(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll break you down)

(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll fake you out)
(I'll break you down)

All I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna
Yeah, and I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
I know what you think in the morning,
When the sun shines on the ground,
And shows what you have done,
It shows where your mind has gone,
And you swear to your parents,
That it will never happen again,
I know, I know what that means, I know.

That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, to take it,
Don't take it, take it, take it.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't
When you all have guns for hands, yeah

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't
When you all have guns for hands, yeah

Let's take this a second at a time,
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme,
Together, let's breathe,
Together, to the beat,
But there's hope out the window,
So that's where we'll go,
Let's go outside and all join hands,
But until then you'll never understand.

That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, to take it,
Don't take it, take it, take it.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't
When you all have guns for hands, yeah.

(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)


(la, da, da, da, da)

We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,
I must forewarn you of my disorder, or my condition,
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,
Interested in putting my fingers to my head,
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music,
It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't
When you all have guns for hands, yeah.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
But I can't, but I can't
When you all have (when you all have) guns for hands, yeah.
I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say hello.

Hello. Hello-oh-o. Hello.

Na na, na na na nah na na. 

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say hello.

Na na, na na na nah na na. 
Hello, hello.
Na na, na na na nah na na. 
Hello, hello.

Hello, hello. 
Now, the night is coming to an end,
Oh

The sun will rise, and we will try again.
Oh

Stay alive, stay alive, for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die.

I will fear the night again,
Oh

I hope I'm not my only friend.
Oh

Stay alive, stay alive, for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,

Take
Pride
In what is sure
To
Die.
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry
Therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm

Can you save—? Can you save my—?
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save—? Can you save my—?
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me, uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "You only live once."
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasise
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasise

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions they're for real
Like "Who would you live for?"
"Who would you die for?"
And "Would you ever kill?"

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
(help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my

I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much
Help me

I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional
What I wanna save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional
What I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets, you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah

I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Good people now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Sometimes you've got to bleed to know,
That you're alive and have a soul,
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I've ever been.

The songs on the radio are ok,
But my taste in music is your face,
And it takes a song to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I've ever been.

Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,
But that's ok, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government,
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time,
But that's ok, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine,
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government,
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement.

Sometimes you've got to bleed to know,
That you're alive and have a soul,
But it takes someone to come around to show you how.

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive,
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire,
She's the tear in my heart, Take me higher,
Than I've ever been.

My heart is my armor,
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver,
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther,
Than I've ever been.

Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been

My heart is my armor,
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver,

They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood,
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless,
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest,
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry
It seems to me
That singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat
In a gas mask
If you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track,
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is
There's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity,
Forget salary,
Forget vanity,
My morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Will they be alive tomorrow? 

They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane boy,"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway,
But will they be alive tomorrow?

When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must've forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please, take me.

Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh

Three lights are lit but the fourth one's out,
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout,
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind's out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I'm thinking, "Wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house."

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
You're the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,

I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.

I don't know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don't know if this one is about me or the devil.

You're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
You're the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing,
Hell's hot for good reason, so please,

Na na na na, oh oh

(You're the judge, oh no, set me free)
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity,
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty,
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety,
Don't know what's inside of me.

Don't forget about me,
Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you, no, no

Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping,
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping,
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,
You are all that I've got, no.

Don't forget about me,
Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no, no

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted,
I want the markings made on my skin,
To mean something to me again,
Hope you haven't left without me.
Hope you haven't left without me, please.


Don't forget about me,
Don't forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no

Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me out
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems

You know where I'm coming
From though I am running
To you, all I feel is deny, deny, denial
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial

Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me out
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems

Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating them, splitting them up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny, deny, denial

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial

Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize
Help me out
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems

We have problems

Domingo en fuego, I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me

Domingo en fuego, I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me

We have problems

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want, we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah! 

Alright. Second verse

What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't wanna know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say, "I wanna die before I'm old"
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah! oh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Ohhohhoh yeah, yeah, yeah! 
Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
No no no no no no (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise,
And who I am today is worse than other times,
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.
I'm wanted and on the run.
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
No no no no no no (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!)

You don't know my brain the way you know my name,
You don't know my heart the way you know my face,
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run.
I'm wanted and on the run.
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

My people singing
My people singing

Hope you're dead
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this,
People, they rhyme like this,
We're all impressed by this,
They rip it, flip it,
But these are just triplets,
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line,
It's just poetry divided.
I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in music to use it
For others to use it,
You're dead
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this.

Life is up here, but you comment below,
And the comments will always become common motivation to promote
Your show's next episode,
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope is far from this moment,
But you and I know it gets better when morning finally rears its head.
Together we're losers,
Remember the future,
Remember the morning is when night is dead.

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session,
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand.

My people singing
My people singing
My people singing
My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Be the one, be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know
You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know
You'll make the fire, my bones will make it grow

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away, put away
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know
How to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
I don't know why, I just feel I'm better off,
Staying in the same room I was born in,
I look outside, and see a whole world better off,
Without me in it trying to transform it,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Listen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds,
But the lyrics are so down,
It's OK though, because it represents, wait better yet, it is,
Who I feel I am right now,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "Not today."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "There's no choice."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

Don't you test me though, just because I play the piano,
Doesn't mean I am not willing to take you down, I'm sorry

I'm, I'm out of my mind, I'm not seeing things right,
I waste all this time trying to run from you,
But I'm, I'm out of my mind.

Heard you say, "Not today."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "There's no choice."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "Not today."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "There's no choice."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise.

Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah

Buh buh bah, not today (not today)

Buh buh bah, buh buh bah (not today, oh nah nah no)
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you

I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you

Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside-out, you're underneath

I've got two faces, blurry's the one I'm not
I've got two faces, blurry's the one I'm not
I need your help to take him out
I need your help to take him out

Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside-out, you're underneath

Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside-out, you're underneath

Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone

Don't let me be
Don't let me be

(Ah, yeah)

I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
Cover me, oh!

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me

Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Dusting off my jumpsuit
(Cover me)

I can't believe how much I hate (Cover me, oh)
Pressures of a new place roll my way (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)

I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh!

Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough
Yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures
I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from; please, keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse
Now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too
You're the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help

Welcome to Trench
Move

Can't stop thinking about if and when I'll die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow

We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no "above", or "under", or "around" it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see

For if and when we go "above", the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going "under" starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode

He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me that's almost stopped me

Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door. What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defence mechanism mode

I'll morph to someone else

Lights they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes

I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no "above", or "under", or "around" it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see

For if and when we go "above", the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going "under" starts to take my wonder
But until that time

I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defence mechanism mode

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
Defence mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

Not done, not done, not done
Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else
When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light and go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you

Surrounded and up against a wall
I'll shred 'em all and go with you
When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat and go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

You don't need to run, you don't need to run
You don't need to run, you don't need to run

If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin
And go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
I'll go with you, I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

You don't need to run, you don't need to run
You don't need to run, you don't need to run

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
(So where are you? It's been a little while...)

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations
Help my body run

I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay

I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Beat is a chemical, yeah
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Beat is a chemical, yeah

(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Moment is medical, yeah

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea

Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
You know
I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know
I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if I’m feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

For you, I’d go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

You know
I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

I would get beat to...
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
On the record for you
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her

I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can’t describe
Just what I’m feeling

For you, I'd go
Write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know
They think it’s messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solving
And my problem?
We glorify those, even more, when they
My opinion
Our culture can treat a loss
Like it's a win and right before we turn on them
We give them the highest of praise, and hang their banner from a ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way
No

Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)

Call, call, call

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?"
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king

Neon gravestones try to call

Neon gravestones try to call for my bones

If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else

But they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

Don't get me wrong
The rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion
In spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And, could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that "it" does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype (don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side

And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

But you'll be just fine

We denounce Vialism
You will leave Dema and head true east
We are Banditos

East is up. I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up. I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up. When Bishops come together, they will know that
Dema don't control us. Dema don't control
East is up

They want to make you forget
They want to make you forget
Save your razorblades now. Not yet
Save your razorblades now. Not yet

I'm heavy. My jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower. I'm higher when I'm heavy. Oh

I'm so high. My jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners. Oh

East is up. I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up. I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes

Lighter when I'm lower. Higher when I'm heavy. Oh

I'm so high. I'm so high
So high. I'm so high
Fire, Nico and the Niners

What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razor-blade stores
Rent a race horse and force a sponsor
And start a concert. A complete diversion
Start a mob, and you can be quite certain
We'll win, but not everyone will get out
No, no

We'll win, but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win, but not everyone will get out

East is up. I'm fearless when I hear this on the low

I'll keep on trying
Might as well

All is well

I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

In city, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered
It's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or a close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him
And named him Jason Statham
I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet

I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

I'll sit here 'til I

You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows
You were one of those classic ones, yeah

Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye

You were here when I wrote this
But the masters and mixes
Will take too long to finish
To show you
I'm sorry I did not visit
Did not know how to take it
When your eyes did not know me
Like I know you

You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows (Wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones, yeah

Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)

Alright (I wish she knew you)
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name
My goodbye

Then the day that it happened
I recorded this last bit
I look forward to having
A lunch with you again
I'm tired
Of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing
Embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

The burning
Is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only
Time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know that it's almost over
They know
They know

In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

Last year
I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year
Though I'm far from home
In TRENCH I'm not alone
These faces facing me

They know
They know
What I mean
